On her way to the cottage of her grandmother, Little Red Riding Hood met an enormous wolf. 'Well, well, well!' said this wicked wolf, 'if it isn't Little Red Riding Hood! Where's our pretty little girl going with her little basket?'</p>

'Better to see you with, darling,' whispered this rascal wolf, with a wicked smile. 'Oh Grandma, what a big nose! I never saw such an enormous nose!' 'Better to smell you with,' said the wolf, and his mouth was watering. 'Oh Grandma, what a big mouth you've got! I never saw such a big mouth!'</p>
