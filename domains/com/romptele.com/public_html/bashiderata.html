        <h1>Bashiderata</h1>
        <p class="stanza">Go thoughtfully amid the loops and pipes,
and remember what power there is in clarity.
As far as possible, without sacrificing correctness,
write scripts that others may understand.</p>
        <p class="stanza">Double-quote your variables vigilantly,
and escape the pitfalls of whitespace and globs;
for even the seasoned scripters stumble.</p>
        <p class="stanza">Avoid the misuse of eval,
for it is the harbinger of vulnerabilities.
Should you call echo,
ensure its arguments are predictable,
lest your intentions be misunderstood.</p>
        <p class="stanza">Embrace <code>$(...)</code> over backticks,
for they nest gracefully and lend clarity.
Learn the nuance of IFS with care;
it holds the key to cleanly parsing data.</p>
        <p class="stanza">Let simplicity guide your aliases and functions,
for cleverness fades in the face of ambiguity.
Remember, Bash is a tool,
not the hammer for every nail.</p>
        <p class="stanza">In complex tasks, call upon Python or AWK,
acknowledging their grace where Bash falters.
When faced with an if or while,
test your conditions as POSIX intends,
and reject the siren song of nonportable flags.</p>
        <p class="stanza">Be mindful of <code>cd</code> and its transient state;
use subshells to contain its reach.
Learn from find, the tireless seeker,
and xargs, its trusted ally.
Together they traverse trees with purpose,
bringing order to chaos.</p>
        <p class="stanza">Harness grep, the discerning eye,
and sed, the quiet transformer.
In their streams lies the poetry of text,
flowing like water through pipes.</p>
        <p class="stanza">Resist the temptation to misuse sudo;
privilege is a weighty key.
And in scripts, set traps to catch missteps,
a guardian against chaos unforeseen.</p>
        <p class="stanza">Seek elegance in loops and arrays,
for Bash, though humble, holds great power.
Yet, do not despair at its quirks;
even its pitfalls are teachers in disguise.</p>
        <p class="stanza">You are a scripter of the Unix universe,
no less than the tools you invoke;
and your shell, like all shells, has its place.</p>
        <p class="stanza">Walk boldly amid its intricacies,
but know when to let go.

Therefore, script with intention,
and whatever your outputs and return codes,
in the complexity of systems,
find harmony with your shell.

With all its edge cases, bugs, and limitations,
it is still a beautiful shell.
Be precise.
Strive to be efficient.</p>
