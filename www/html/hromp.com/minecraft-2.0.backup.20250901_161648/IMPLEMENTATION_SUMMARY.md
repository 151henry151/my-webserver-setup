# Password Reset Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

The password reset functionality for the Minecraft Clicker game has been successfully implemented and tested. Here's what's now available:

### 🔐 Enhanced Registration System
- **Email Required**: All new user registrations now require an email address
- **Email Validation**: Proper email format validation is enforced
- **Unique Email**: Each email can only be used for one account

### 📧 Password Reset via Email
- **Forgot Password Page**: `/forgot-password.html` - Users can request password resets
- **Reset Password Page**: `/reset-password.html` - Users can set new passwords
- **Secure Token System**: Time-limited, single-use tokens for security
- **Email Delivery**: Automatic email sending with reset links

### 🛡️ Security Features
- **Token Expiration**: Reset links expire after 1 hour
- **Single Use**: Each token can only be used once
- **Cryptographic Security**: Uses secure random token generation
- **Email Privacy**: System doesn't reveal if an email exists or not

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Users

#### 1. Registration
1. Go to the game page
2. Click "Register"
3. Fill in username, email, and password
4. Click "Confirm Registration"
5. Return to login and sign in

#### 2. Password Reset
1. Click "Forgot Password?" on the login form
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email for the reset link
4. Click the link and enter a new password
5. Use your new password to log in

### For Administrators

#### Email Configuration
Set these environment variables for email functionality:

```bash
export SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
export SMTP_PORT=587
export SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
export SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
export FROM_EMAIL=noreply@hromp.com
```

**Note**: For Gmail, you need to:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication
2. Generate an "App Password"
3. Use the app password instead of your regular password

#### Development Mode
If no email credentials are configured, the system will:
- Print reset links to the console instead of sending emails
- Still function for testing purposes
